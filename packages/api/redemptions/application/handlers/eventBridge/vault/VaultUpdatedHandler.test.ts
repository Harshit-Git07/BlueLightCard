// TODO(TR-187): Jest doesn't support ESM syntax, so typed-inject is not supported.
//               Switching to Vitest would allow us to write integration tests for this handler.
//               For now, we'll skip this test as configuring Jest or switching to Vitest are
//               both out of scope for this ticket.
