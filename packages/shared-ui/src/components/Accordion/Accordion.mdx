## Overview

Accordion component accepting any children components as content, with dynamic sizing and group capabilties. It can optionally fire
an amplitude event when the accordion is opened and the icons for open/expand, and close/collapse, are customisable. 

## Props

<Controls />

## State

### Single Accordion

<Canvas of={Accordion.Default} />

### Multiple Accordions

Accordions are grouped by specifying a value for the `groupId` prop and have slightly different styles for readability in a group,
including a slighty bolder title font, a content background colours and alternative spacing.

<Canvas of={Accordion.Groups} />

## Implementation
Usage example using jsx

**NOTE:** accordions sharing the same `groupId` will only be able to be opened one at a time, regardless of visual grouping. Likewise,
a visual group of accordions will be able to open independantly of each other if the `groupId` is not set.

```jsx
const MyComponentWithAccordions: FC<Props> = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <section>
        <h2>Accordion Group 1</h2>
        <Accordion
          title="Accordion #1 : Custom icons for open/close "
          groupId="group1"
          openIcon={faEye}
          closeIcon={faEyeSlash}
        >
          {content}
        </Accordion>
        <Accordion
          title="Accordion #2 : Render any content or components, in any layout"
          groupId="group1"
        >
          {content}
        </Accordion>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Ungrouped Accordions</h2>
        <Accordion title="Accordion #5 : I can be opened independent of #6">{content}</Accordion>
        <Accordion title="Accordion #6 : I can be opened independent of #5">{content}</Accordion>
      </section>
    </>
  );
};
```
