## Overview

The main selection area of the FileUpload.
This component allows a user to select a set of files,
either by them dragging those files into the drop area,
or by selecting them after clicking a button.

This component does not manage file uploads,
or the state of file selection.
It relies on its parent to manage these.
See *ExampleUploadWrapper* for an example of upload management.

The component is configurable on
which filetypes are allowed to be selected,
how many files are allowed to be selected in one go,
and how large uploaded files can be.

The component has a default and disabled state.

The text that informs a user that the area is able to receive files
is removed on tablet and mobile sizes.

## Props
