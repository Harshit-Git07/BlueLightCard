These files are duplicates of shared components that are used by both the MyAccount and Eligibility teams.

This isn't the way any of us like to work, but with pressures to complete the 'personal information' screen, ill-timed code freezes and rolloffs, it was the quickest and safest solution to move forward.

The intention is to reconcile both files at a later date, which will require input from design due to conflicting UX and so on (e.g. the 'main' dropdown pushes content down below it and has no max size by default).

The dropdown is the source of most pain and will require the most work to reconcile into a single version, whereas the other files in this folder (text-input and floating placeholder) should be quite easy to recombine. The DatePicker is heavily reliant on the dropdown and so the effort there will depend on what route is taken WRT the dropdown.
