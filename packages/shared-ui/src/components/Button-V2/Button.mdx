## Overview
Buttons are clickable items used for actions and to trigger events, for example, opening/closing a dialogue, cancelling an action or performing a delete operation or submitting a form. They can have different styles depending on their needs.

Tertiary buttons, which look similar to links, are used for less important or less commonly used actions.

## Props
<Controls />

## Usage
➡️ Buttons may contain icon, on the left or the right side, padding between icon and text is 8px.

➡️ Use 8 px spacing between buttons stacked horizontally and 16px space between buttons stacked vertically.

➡️ Replace text with a loading action is submitted, but still processing(Out of scope) 24px horizontal padding and fixed height based on each button size.

➡️ Button is always set to hug contents avoid changing width. In certain layouts button width fills container i.e mobile screen.

➡️ Use only one primary button per content area, and any remaining calls to action (CTA) should be represented as lower emphasis buttons.

➡️ Should have just 1 word for explaining the action; a maximum of 3 words where only the first one will be capitalised something

➡️ If two buttons are stacked horizontally, secondary action uses secondary button at min width and primary action fills containerMust include sub-section on accessibility
