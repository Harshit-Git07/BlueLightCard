# Badge

## Overview

- This component renders a badge with a string.
- It accepts dynamic background colors, labels and sizes.
- It accepts 2 sizes: large | small. Large should be used for desktop platform, and small for mobile platform.
- Platform is optional and will be used to define the absolute position of the badge, that only applies if the Badge has a large size.

## Props

<Controls />

## Usage

```js
<Badge label="Online" color="bg-[#000000]" size="small" />
```

- `color` prop must be in the string format `bg-[#000000]`

## Styling Issues

- Although you may see all styles being applied correctly in storybook stories, **once you incorporate this component in other packages, the rendering of the styles may not be applied correctly**.

- The shared-ui library may present some Tailwind issues while using this component in other packages, like web or mobile-hybrid.
  Some classes with **arbitrary values** or native get purged by tailwind since they don't exist in the web/mobile-hybrid packages.

#### **Solution:**

- The classes that don't apply correctly with tailwind must be **converted to css classes or inline styling**.
- For static styles, you can add new css classes in `./styles/style.css` file (make sure to add the component name at the start of the class name).
- For dynamic styles, you can use inline styling, like the background color for the Badge component.
