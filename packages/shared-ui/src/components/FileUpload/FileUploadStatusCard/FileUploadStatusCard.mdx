## Overview
The status card that informs a user of what state their file upload is in.

The visual states are:
- Loading
- Success
- Error

## Variants and States
The Loading State that is shown when a file is being uploaded.
<Canvas of={FileUploadStatusCard.Loading} />

The Success State that is shown after a file has successfully been uploaded.
<Canvas of={FileUploadStatusCard.Success} />

The Error State that is shown after a file failed to upload.
A message can be optionally added.
<Canvas of={FileUploadStatusCard.ErrorWithMessage} />

## Implementation
Provide the following props:
- `fileName` - displays the filename to the user
- `uploadStatus` - determines icon and colours to render
- `removeFile` - callback when the 'x' button is pressed
- `message` - optional message to display errors (can be used for success if needed)

See the *ExampleUploadWrapper* for an example of Implementation.
