## Overview

- This component renders a OfferCardCarousel.
- It renders 2 Cards for "Deals of the week" case and 3 cards for the remaining cases on desktop.
- It renders one card for mobile and two cards for tablet.

## Props

<Controls />

## Usage

```js
<OfferCardCarousel offers={[]} />
```

## Styling Issues

- Although you may see all styles being applied correctly in storybook stories, **once you incorporate this component in other packages, the rendering of the styles may not be applied correctly**.

- The shared-ui library may present some Tailwind issues while using this component in other packages, like web or mobile-hybrid.
  Some classes with **arbitrary values** or native get purged by tailwind since they don't exist in the web/mobile-hybrid packages.

#### **Solution:**

- The classes that don't apply correctly with tailwind must be **converted to css classes or inline styling**.
- For static styles, you can add new css classes in `./styles/style.css` file (make sure to add the component name at the start of the class name).
- For dynamic styles, you can use inline styling, like the background color for the Badge component.
