## Introduction
A brief overview of the project, its purpose, and its main functionalities.
Describe the problem it solves and the intended audience.

### Example:
This project is a RESTful API for managing a redemptions. It supports CRUD operations for offers. The API is designed to be scalable, secure, and easy to extend.

## Tech Stack
List the technologies, frameworks, and tools used in the project.

### Example:
Application: SST
IAC: Terraform
Testing: Jest, playwright


## Project Structure
Outline the directory structure and briefly explain the purpose of each major folder.

### Example:
/src
/components        # Reusable UI components
/services          # Business logic and API calls
/models            # Database models
/routes            # API route definitions
/config            # Configuration files and environment variables
/tests               # Unit and integration tests
/scripts             # Utility scripts for deployment, migrations, etc.

## Architecture Overview
PRovide a high-level diagram or description of the system architecture. Explain how the components interact with each other.
Tis can be done with Mermaid : https://mermaid.js.org/

### Example:
The system follows a microservices architecture, with separate services for user management, task management, and notifications.
All services communicate via a message queue (RabbitMQ) and are deployed as lambda functions.

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
List the necessary software and versions that must be installed.

### Example:
Node.js v18.x
Docker v20.x
PostgreSQL v12.x

## Setting Up Locally
Step-by-step guide to setting up the development environment locally.

### Example:
Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-project.git```

Install dependencies:
```npm install```

Configure environment variables:
Copy .env.example to .env and update the values.

Start the development server:
```npm run dev```

## Running Tests
How to run the test suite, including any specific commands or configurations.

### Example:
Unit Tests:
```npm run test:unit```
Integration Tests:
```npm run test:integration```

## Git Workflow
Describe the Git workflow used by the team.

### Example:
We follow the Gitflow branching strategy:

main: Contains production-ready code.
release-please-xxxxxx : Release branch.
feature/<name>: Branches for new features.
hotfix/<name>: Branches for urgent fixes in production.

## Branching Guidelines:
Always branch off main for new features.
Create a pull request to merge into main.
Use meaningful commit messages and keep commits atomic.

# Best Practices

## Coding Standards
Outline the coding standards and style guides followed in the project.

### Example:
Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide.
Use ESLint for linting.
All new code must be covered by unit tests with at least 80% coverage.

## Do’s and Don’ts
Specific guidelines to help maintain code quality and project integrity.

### Example:
Do:
Write meaningful commit messages.
Document your code thoroughly.
Write tests for all new features.

Don’t
Push code with failing tests.

# Deployment

## Staging Environment
How to deploy to the staging environment, including necessary permissions and procedures.

### Example:
Merge your feature branch into main.
Github will automatically deploy to staging.

## Production Deployment
Steps to deploy to production, including approval processes and rollback procedures.

### Example:
Ensure all tests pass and the code is reviewed.
merge the release-please PR. Github will deploy automatically
Monitor logs and metrics post-deployment.

## Troubleshooting
Common issues and how to resolve them.

### Example:
Database connection errors: Check the DB_HOST environment variable.
Docker build fails: Ensure Docker is running and that you have the correct permissions.

## Documentation
Links to additional documentation, such as API docs, style guides, or design documents.
