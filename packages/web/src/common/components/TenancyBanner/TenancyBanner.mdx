## Status

## Overview

- This component retrieves and renders the tenancy banner carousel of sponsored adverts from Blue Light Card partners
- The banner supports two variants for the types of tenancy banner to show: large or small
- The banner is tokenised according to the design system
- The banner is keyboard accessible where appropriate
  - There is however likely a limitation with accessibility here as the tenancy banners currently do not have any data to provide a user friendly label
- The data for the banner is currently provided via the getBanners GraphQL query
- This component is located within Web only due to this current coupling to GraphQL, which prevents the component from being reusable in Mobile Hybrid
- In future, it may be possible to consolidate Web and Hybrid tenancy banners into Shared UI if we replatform the endpoint into a new REST API

## Props

<Controls />

## State

The banner uses shared state via Jotai for storing all of the loaded banner data returned from the query, all versions of the banner should share the same state

## Usage

Use this component when you need to load either large or small tenancy banners into the page:

```jsx
const ExamplePage = () => (
  <body>
    <Header>
      <TenancyBanner variant="large" />
    </Header>

    <Footer>
      <TenancyBanner variant="small" />
    </Footer>
  </body>
);
```

## Design

There is currently no design available for this component, however:

- the large variant should look identical to the promo banner carousel on the Web Home page
- the small variant should look identical to the adverts banner carousel on the Web Search page
