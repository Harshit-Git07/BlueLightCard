We always write Typescript following the following conventions:
- Always use single quotes
- Two spaces for indentation
- Always add trailing commas

Tests are written in Jest and should be placed in a directory named `__tests__` in the same directory as the code under test. Error 
cases should be handled first followed by success cases. Focus on testing behaviours rather than just calling functions.
