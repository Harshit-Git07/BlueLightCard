## Overview
This is an *_EXAMPLE_* component
to show what a FileUpload component could look like on a page.
This is only a reference for designers to see the components interact,
and for developers to see an example of how to tie the components together in code.

## Props

<Controls />

## Variants and States
There are no variants of this component.
<Canvas of={ExampleUploadWrapper.Default} />

## Implementation
This component should not be implemented directly.
Developers are able to copy parts of this component to use
when they build the form that surrounds the FileUpload component.

## Usage Guidelines
When building the surrounding form component, you should:
- control the state of selected files
  - provide the `FileUploadBody` component a way to add files to the selection
  - provide the `FileUploadStatusCard` components a way to remove its respective file from the selection
- manage the file upload process
- update state in the `FileUploadStatusCard`s as uploads are accepted / rejected by the server
  - provide errors to the `FileUploadStatusCard` where relevant via the `message` prop
